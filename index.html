                     The salt water fly fishermen can chose between challenging surf conditions on reefs or flat calm conditions in estuaries, targeting elf (bluefish), garrick or guitarfish. The brave can tackle the cape sailfish (snoek), yellowtail or tuna offshore.

                        <strong> The climbing</strong>
                        This is a great crag for beginners, with a few challenging routes for others. Crack of Dawn is a splendid crack climb for practicing trad climbing (dont anybody ever bolt it please!!) A walk up to the top of the crag allows you clip the ring bolts to setup topropes for climbs without any lead bolts (be carefull clipping the top anchors, we recommed a safety line when doing this).                             
                    </p>

                        <strong>Getting there</strong>
                        Located above Boyes Drive. Take the M3 from Cape Town. Get onto Boyes Drive. Park on the side of the road (Boyes Drive). A short uphill walk gets you to the crag. The crag can be identified by the pinnacle that stands away from the rock.
